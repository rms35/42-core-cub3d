# cub3D

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by rafael-m.*

## Description
cub3D is a 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective, inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D. This project explores the principles of **Ray-casting**, a 2.5D rendering technique.

## Goals
- Mastering the **miniLibX** library.
- Implementing the **DDA (Digital Differential Analysis)** algorithm.
- Handling window management, events, and textures in C.
- Deepening knowledge of linear algebra and trigonometry in a practical context.

## How it Works
The engine shoots rays from the player's position across the FOV. For each ray, the DDA algorithm finds the nearest wall intersection. The distance to the wall is then used to calculate the vertical height of the wall stripe on the screen, creating the illusion of 3D.
